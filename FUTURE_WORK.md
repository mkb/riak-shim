## The future - mkb

Riak-shim will follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) as best I can
manage.

My idea is to keep tweaking riak-shim to suit my own needs for two internal
projects I am working on.  Right before the first of those goes into
production I'll declare a 1.0 release.  At that point, minor version releases
might introduce new functionality, but won't break what is already here.

For the past few weeks riak-shim has been fairly stable and hasn't needed
significant changes.  I am hopeful that we can avoid incompatable updates for
a while.

## TODOS

- YARD
- Examples directory
- Keep working on docs
- Keep expanding tests
- find less horrible way to deal with index names
- find less horrible way to deal with key accessor
- nice error message when can't connect to db
