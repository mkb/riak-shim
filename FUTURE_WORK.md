## The future - mkb

Riak-shim follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) as best I can
manage.

After plenty of production use, riak-shim hasn't needed much beyond
gem bumps. The project will be pretty stable for the forseeable
future.

# TODOS

- Ongoing updates for Ruby and gem versions
- Alternative to database.yml for config to avoid collisions with AR
- Improve docs
- Integrate with coveralls.io
- Check forks for changes to incorporate
- find less horrible way to deal with index names
- find less horrible way to deal with key accessor
- nice error message when back end doesn't support 2i
- nice error message when secondary index is missing?
